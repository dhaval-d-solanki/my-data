I will not say Happy Valentine Day to you..

for one moment I was thinking that because it would not be fair to other days of the year.. because they are not less than today for me in any way.. So 

Happy Valentine Day to my lovely wife,  from me and on behalf of other 364 days of the year.. Love you so much
